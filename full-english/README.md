# Full English
Full English is (currently) a collection of one townset newGRF. This town building NewGRF provides a comprehensive set of UK themed buildings for 1950 to 2050. It is in an 8-bit pixel art style, stylistically very similar to the OpenGFX2 base set, with 1x (64 px tile width) and full zoom (4x, 256 px tile width) graphics.

The Full English UK Townset is simple to use and pleasing to look at. Just load the NewGRF and enjoy a game.

## Features
* Many building types. You'll find cottages, housed, semis, terraces, office blocks, skyscrapers, warehouses, supermarkets, churches, graveyards and parks.
* Custom town zone control. You'll only find skyscrapers in a small, central, high rise area.
* Smart building orientation. You'll find terraced houses and shops nicely oriented to face roads and hedges, fences and walls with openings next to the roads. 
* Huge building variation. All buildings have many variants, you'll find alternates with different colours, different fences and different garden trees.
* Climate and baseset sensitivity. You'll find full climate support, matching the climate-specific grass and trees from your baseset and climate.
* Building clustering and smart appearance. You'll find parks and churches/graveyards grow organically and neighbouring tiles attach nicely.
* Per town theming. You'll find towns which prefer brick, stone or painted buildings.

## Parameters
Two parameters are available:

1. Enable or disable default OpenTTD buildings (default disabled).
2. Allow skyscrapers in only cities, all towns or disable skyscrapers (default cities only).

There is no NewGRF parameter to enable/disable the 4x zoom graphics. If you'd like to disable the extra zoom graphics then you can use the OpenTTD advanced setting "Highest resolution sprites to use". If you set that to `1x`, then Full English will match nicely with 1x zoom basesets and NewGRFs.

## Interoperability
The Full English townset is tested for standalone use with default industries, eg. the buildings accept passengers, mail, goods and food and produce passengers and mail. It _should_ behave nicely if loaded with other NewGRFs providing town buildings, but it is recommended to use it as your only town building NewGRF.

Full English is a 'spiritual successor' to the UK Town Set. But, it was developed and coded independently, so it is not a drop in replacement.

## Development
if you find bugs or have feature requests then please post them as Github issues on my [OpenTTD NewGRF Github repo](https://github.com/zephyris/openttd-newgrf).
